Title: Recycle Me!

Project Overview: 

The aim of this web application is to practice proper recycling. Currently the app for Hillsboro waste recycling does not have a feature that tells citizens what is recylable and what is waste. This app wil help reduce, if not eliminate, "Wishful Recycling" which is where customer's wish items that are not recyclable become so. This is a problem because it impedes the ability of waste servicers to properly recycle items. 

User stories

As a citizen, I want to know what can and can't be recycled so I can seperate my trash correctly and responsibly. 
As a customer, I want to know what to do with non recyclable products so that I am not fined.
As a business, I want my customers to follow rules accordingly to maximize potential profits and cut down costs.
As an environmentalist, I want clean streets, water, and air. If everybody is educated about "reduce, reuse, and recycle" our carbon footprint can be reduced.
